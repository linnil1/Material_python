# simulate particle in the box

I use vpython , so it need to use on Windows or using Wine

the main file is init.py

Because It is cpu-comsuming,
so i divide it to initcal.py and initshow.py

and initcalc.py will produce csv file (no vpython function),
so i can run on workstation

initshow.py will show result on your window ( vpython)

the csv data is put on /tmp/pvnrt/
